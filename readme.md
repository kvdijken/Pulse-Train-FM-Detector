This project contains:

- a description of the workings of a pulse train FM detector
- a Jupyter notebook containing a mathematical model of a pulse train FM detector. 

A pulse train FM detector translates a message which is encoded as a frequency deviation of a carrier into the encoding message. It can be used as the FM detector in a FM radio receiver. My impression is that it is not used much, although (when implemented well) it works very good and has low part count. Also once implemented, it does not need tuning.

An excellent introduction and demonstration to FM Pulse Counting can be found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQlN2fc7LJc&t=717s. The explanation of its functioning presented there is not complete however.

The pulse train FM detector which is described in this project is part of the FM Receiver from the FM Receiver project at https://github.com/kvdijken/FM-Receiver. A vidoe of this FM Receiver can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlIiLwKdwg0&t=1s.
